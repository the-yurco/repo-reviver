# ðŸ“¬ Repo Reviver

* **What it is**: A sleek tool to keep tabs on your GitHub projects, spotlighting those you've left dormant.  
* **Why it helps**: Side projects often fade into the background, cluttering your GitHub and weighing on your mind. Repo Reviver nudges you to revive, annotate, or neatly archive them.  
* **What it does**:  
  * Displays your GitHub repos with their latest activity in a clear, elegant dashboard.  
  * Lets you choose repos to watch and set custom inactivity alerts (e.g., "notify me if untouched for 30 days").  
  * Sends friendly email reminders to reconnect with idle projects.  
  * Allows quick notes (e.g., "Paused for new job") to capture your projectâ€™s context.  
  * Simplifies archiving old repos to keep your GitHub profile polished and organized.  
* **Why itâ€™s great**: Saves you time, clears mental clutter, and transforms your project management into a stress-free, inspiring experienceâ€”letting you focus on creating, not chasing.
